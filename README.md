# BTC-Risk
Foundation of a Risk Metric for BTC.

This is a personal project, first fit in January 2024, which has served as a foundation for my investment strategy since then. While I have done further work in improving the metric and associated strategy, only a baseline is provided. 

This involves momentum, where risk is derived from the ratio of the 8W and 50W SMAs. Furthermore, there is a factor related to diminishing returns. Data from 29/12/2010 is considered.

My investment strategy runs parallel to that which is detailed: i.e. depending on risk, invest/sell a % of current cash/holdings per period.
